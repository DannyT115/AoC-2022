Advent of Code 2022 Repository

## What is Advent of Code?
[**Advent of Code**](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent Calender of programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets  
and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.  
People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework,  
practice problems or just as a general challenge.

The personal reasons that I decided to start going through the Advent of Code, is so that I can start  
getting used to new languages that might be useful to me in the future. It allows you to question certain  
aspects of languages that you have not used before. By following Advent of Code, you can identify areas that you need to work on,  
whilst simultaneously increasing your skill level in programming overall.

## What is the purpose of this repository?
This repository will be filled with solutions for the Advent of Code challenges using GoLang. Doing this
should give me an understanding of the language itself, due to the more "Practical" way of learning.
